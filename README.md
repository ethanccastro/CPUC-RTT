<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was a 2021 Capstone project at CSUMB, designed to analyze the California Public Utilities Commission data from their mobile field tests from the west coast of the United States. 

* All of the data analysis work are in a code snippet on the front homepage of the website
* There are multiple source files dedicated to the extraction of columns from Excel sheets
* Although the functionality is a bit funky, there are interactive graphs to generate different results


### Resources

The bulk of the project was done with Python and its libraries, complimented with HTML/CSS.

* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* Pandas
